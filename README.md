# **Exsh — A Custom Unix Shell in C**

![Alt Text](exsh.png)

---


Welcome to **Exsh**, A Unix like shell written in pure C. This project mimics the core behavior of Unix shells — covering command parsing, pipes, input/output redirection, process creation with `fork()`, and execution using `execvp()`.

🔬 Designed for learning, OS-level process management, and understanding how real shells like Bash work.


## 🌟 Features

| Shell Feature                 | Exsh Implementation                                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Interactive Prompt            | Tracks command history, `<C-r>` search and cursor control |
| Command Execution             | Runs system commands with arguments                 |
| Pipes                   | Connects output of one command to input of another |
| Input/Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`) | Redirects stdin/stdout to files           |
| Built-in Commands             | `cd`, `exit`                                        |
| Process Management            | `fork()`, `execvp()`, `wait()` for process control |
